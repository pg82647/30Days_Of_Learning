<summary> Day 1 - March 1, 2025 </summary>  

#### Goal For Today: Learn Advanced Excel Functions  

#### What I Learned Today:  
* I learnt how to apply VLOOKUP function to a data table in Excel.  
* I also learned how to apply XLOOKUP function to a data table in Excel.  
* I learnt how to use the TODAY function to get add a Date column to an Excel table, as well as how to use the NOW function to provide Date in Timestamp form.  
#### Challenge Faced:
* The XLOOKUP function was not available in my Excel version (Excel 2019).  
#### How I Overcame Challenges:  
* I had to use Excel on the Web where i could easily use the function to practice.  
#### Practice:  
* I applied the VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP functions to a table in order to find out the prices of Sugar Cookie and Chocolate Chip.

### Goal For Today: Understanding The Data Analysis Process  

![THE DATA ANALYSIS PROCESS](Day2/images/dap1.jpg)  


#### What I Learned Today:  
* I learnt that there are rules that guide the actions of every data analyst from the moment they are tasked with a problem till they present their findings to stakeholders.  
* I realized that some stages tend to overlap and may be repetitive, for instance, the Data Cleaning phase. Still on the Data Cleaning phase, i learnt that data analysts must always bear in mind that all data gathered/sourced for any project/task are never clean enough and so must ensure that even though the data is not thoroughly cleaned, it should be far cleaner than when they had first received them.  
* I learnt that even though there are numerous tools for data analysis at the disposal of the analyst, they must ensure that the tools they choose for the analytical process must be compatible with the data sourced.  
* i also learnt that data visualization options must be applied with their target audience at heart. In otherwords, the choice of data visualization must be easy to understand by the target audience so that the analytical process can be more meaningful.  
* I learnt that communicating facts that have been gleamed from the data must be conducted in very comprehensible language so that the target audience can understand the message being passed.  

#### Reflections:  
A data analyst's job is never done until the message is perfectly understood by the target audience. Therefore, we should as much as we can ensure that people comprehend what we are doing, else, the entire process would be meaningless.

### Goal For Today: The 10,000-hour rule  

![Desena](Day3/images/dol_1.jpeg)  

![Ericsson](Day3/images/dol_2.png)  


#### What I Learned Today:  
* I learnt that Anders Ericsson, a psychologist, posited that for anyone to be great at something, they have to dedicate a minimum of 10,000 hours to learning that thing. In other words, if you want to be great at something, you have to put in a minimum of 10,000 hours of deliberate, structured, and focused practice. His research helps us to learn and improve easier and much faster. But it all depends on just how far you are willing to go at that thing, and provided the rules guiding it (that new thing you are learning) do not change.  
This theory was made popular by Malcolm Gladwell.  

#### Reflection:  
To be better than 95% of people in an industry, i need to dedicate a minimum of 18 minutes of focused learning per day at one thing.

![DATA IS THE NEW OIL](Day4/images/dolc2.jpg)  


#### What I Learnt Today:  
"Information is the oil of the 21st century, and analytics is the combustion engine " - Peter Sondergaard.

By this comparison, the importance of data and its processing in the 21st century is made clear.
Oil was the most importance resource of the 20th century. Today, data is the most valuable resource. And just as oil is of little relevance until refined, the true value of data remains untapped until it gets analyzed. Similarly, as a combustion engine transforms oil into energy, data analytics transforms information into insights that drive decisions, and give a competitive edge.
So, all economic agents (individuals, businesses, governments, etc) rely on data for a competitive edge.

![Economic_Development](Day6/images/dolc3.jpg)  


#### What I Learnt Today:  
The relationship between past crime organizations and current economic development in rich countries is multifaceted. Historically, organized crime has often thrived in environments where central governments and civil society are disorganized, weak, or untrustworthy. This can occur during periods of political, economic, or social turmoil or transition, such as changes in government or rapid economic development.  

In many rich countries, the legacy of organized crime can be seen in several ways:  
Economic Impact: Organized crime groups have historically engaged in a variety of illegal activities, including drug trafficking, money laundering, and fraud. These activities can distort economic markets, divert resources from productive uses, and create inefficiencies. For example, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has identified Mexican transnational criminal organizations (TCOs) as the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States, highlighting their dominance in drug trafficking.  
Institutional Weakness: The presence of organized crime can weaken institutions, including law enforcement and the judiciary. This can lead to a lack of trust in these institutions, which is crucial for economic development. Strong and trustworthy institutions are essential for maintaining the rule of law, protecting property rights, and ensuring a stable business environment.  
Social Control: Criminal organizations often seek to develop social control over specific communities, which can lead to a parallel system of governance. This can undermine the legitimacy of the state and create areas where the state has limited influence. For instance, in some regions, criminal groups provide protection and social services, which can make it difficult for the state to regain control.  
Economic Inequality: There is compelling evidence that economic inequality is positively correlated with crime. Economic inequality can alienate individuals from societal institutions and values, leading to social resistance and engagement in criminal behavior. This relationship has been studied in various contexts, including developed countries, where economic inequality can contribute to higher crime rates.  
Historical Context: In some cases, the historical presence of organized crime has left a lasting impact on the economic and social fabric of a country. For example, the legacy of the Italian Mafia in Italy and the Yakuza in Japan has influenced the development of these countries' economies and social structures. These organizations have sometimes been integrated into legitimate business activities, creating a complex interplay between legal and illegal economies.  
Policy Implications: Understanding the historical relationship between organized crime and economic development is crucial for policymakers. Interventions that aim to reduce economic inequality and strengthen institutions can help mitigate the negative impacts of organized crime. For example, public participation programs and efforts to improve financial literacy can help reduce social resistance and the propensity for criminal behavior.
In summary, the relationship between past crime organizations and current economic development in rich countries is characterized by the impact of organized crime on economic markets, institutional strength, social control, and economic inequality. Addressing these issues is essential for fostering sustainable economic development and reducing the influence of organized crime.

### Goal For Today:  Feminine Hurricane Names And Increased Deadliness  

![Satelite_Image_of_a_hurricane](Day8/images/dolc1.jpg)  

#### What I Learnt Today: 
Feminine Hurricane Names and Increased Deadliness: This is a well-known finding from a study published in Nature Geoscience (2014), which found that hurricanes with feminine names are deadlier than those with masculine names, primarily due to implicit biases. The study was conducted by researchers at the University of Illinois and the University of Michigan, and it looked at the effect of names on public perception and preparedness. You can find it referenced in news articles about gender bias, such as The New York Times and The Guardian.

### Goal For Today:  Maternal Mortality In Sub-Saharan Africa  

![Maternal Mortality Rate in Sub-Saharan Africa](Day10/images/dolc1.jpg)  

![Mother and Child](Day10/images/dolc2.jpg)  

#### What I Learnt Today:  
Maternal mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa remains a significant health challenge, despite global efforts to improve maternal health outcomes. The region has some of the highest maternal mortality ratios (MMR) in the world. Several factors contribute to this, including limited access to quality healthcare, poor infrastructure, and socioeconomic disparities. Here's an overview of the situation:  

##### 1. **Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) in Sub-Saharan Africa**  
- Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for **66% of global maternal deaths**, even though the region represents about 13% of the global population.  
- The maternal mortality ratio in Sub-Saharan Africa is estimated to be about **542 deaths per 100,000 live births** (as of the most recent estimates), significantly higher than the global average of around **211 deaths per 100,000 live births**.  
- Some countries, such as **Chad, Sierra Leone, and Nigeria**, have particularly high MMRs, while others have made significant progress in reducing maternal deaths.  

##### 2. **Key Factors Contributing to Maternal Mortality**  
- __Lack of Access to Quality Healthcare__: Many women in rural and remote areas lack access to skilled birth attendants, emergency obstetric care, and essential healthcare services, especially during childbirth.  
- __Inadequate Infrastructure__: Poor healthcare infrastructure, such as a lack of hospitals, clinics, and transportation facilities, complicates access to timely care.  
- __Limited Financial Resources__: The cost of healthcare, even when available, can be prohibitive for many families in Sub-Saharan Africa, leading to delays in seeking care or not seeking care at all.
- __Malnutrition and Pre-existing Health Conditions__: High rates of malnutrition, anemia, and other health conditions such as HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis can increase the risk of complications during pregnancy and childbirth.  
- __Cultural and Socioeconomic Barriers__: In some regions, cultural beliefs and practices may discourage women from seeking formal medical care, opting instead for traditional birth attendants or home births. Additionally, gender inequality, early marriages, and low education levels among women may restrict their access to healthcare.  
- __Unmet Family Planning Needs__: High fertility rates and a lack of access to contraceptive methods contribute to unplanned pregnancies, which can increase maternal risks, especially among adolescents.  

##### 3. **Major Causes of Maternal Deaths**  
- **Hemorrhage (excessive bleeding)**: This is one of the leading causes of maternal death, especially in the aftermath of complicated births.  
- __Infections__: Puerperal sepsis (infection after childbirth) and other infections during pregnancy and childbirth contribute significantly to maternal mortality.  
- __Hypertensive Disorders__: Conditions like preeclampsia and eclampsia (high blood pressure during pregnancy) are significant causes of maternal death.  
- __Obstructed Labor__: When labor cannot proceed normally, often due to the baby being too large or malpositioned, it can lead to life-threatening complications.  
- __Unsafe Abortion__: In regions where abortion is highly restricted, women may resort to unsafe procedures, leading to complications and maternal deaths.  

##### 4. **Progress and Efforts to Reduce Maternal Mortality**  
__Improved Access to Family Planning__: Expanding access to family planning and contraceptive services has been a key strategy in reducing unintended pregnancies and improving maternal health.  
__Skilled Birth Attendants and Emergency Care__: Many countries in the region have focused on increasing the number of skilled birth attendants (doctors, nurses, and midwives) and providing emergency obstetric care.  
__Health Financing and Investments__: Increasing investments in maternal health, including improving the supply of medicines, equipment, and training healthcare providers, can make a significant difference.  
__Community Health Programs__: Community-based health workers and programs that focus on education, vaccination, and early intervention have been successful in raising awareness about maternal health.  
__Global and Regional Initiatives__: Organizations like the **World Health Organization (WHO)**, **United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)**, and **African Union (AU)** have launched several initiatives aimed at reducing maternal mortality, such as the **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3** to reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births by 2030.  
__Improving Antenatal and Postnatal Care__: More emphasis is being placed on quality antenatal care to monitor and prevent complications during pregnancy and improve postnatal care, especially for newborns and mothers in the postpartum period.  

##### 5. **The Way Forward**  
__Strengthening Health Systems__: There is a need to ensure health systems are equipped to provide quality, affordable, and accessible maternal health services, including emergency care.  
__Addressing Social Determinants__: Reducing maternal mortality requires addressing broader social and economic factors, such as gender inequality, poverty, and education.
__Engaging Men and Communities__: Engaging families, men, and communities in maternal health efforts can lead to better health outcomes for women. This involves promoting the value of maternal health and encouraging support for women during pregnancy and childbirth.  

In summary, while significant challenges remain, Sub-Saharan Africa has made progress in addressing maternal mortality, and continued investments in healthcare, education, and social reforms are essential to further reducing maternal deaths in the region.
