### Day 1 - March 1, 2025  
#### Goal For Today: Learn Advanced Excel Functions  
#### What I Learned:  
* I learnt how to apply VLOOKUP function to a data table in Excel.  
* I also learned how to apply XLOOKUP function to a data table in Excel.  
* I learnt how to use the TODAY function to get add a Date column to an Excel table, as well as how to use the NOW function to provide Date in Timestamp form.  
#### Challenge Faced:
* The XLOOKUP function was not available in my Excel version (Excel 2019).  
#### How I Overcame Challenges:  
* I had to use Excel on the Web where i could easily use the function to practice.  
#### Practice:  
* I applied the VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP functions to a table in order to find out the prices of Sugar Cookie and Chocolate Chip.

#### Reflection:  
* Even though the VLOOKUP is quite useful, the XLOOKUP seems easier to use because it focuses more on columns, therefore, making it easier to capture targeted detail(s).
